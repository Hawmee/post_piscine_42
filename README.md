Most of those Project have their own "main.c"
to test each project , compile the with :
cc -Wall -Wexta -Werror *.c


Warrant :
THese project are not validated by norminette cause they are made 
in purpose to test my logic and share them . (And maybe it is like that ,
so you cant copy paste blindly . Enjoy your copy and paste it with your
own touch of logic to avoid norminette logic.)
